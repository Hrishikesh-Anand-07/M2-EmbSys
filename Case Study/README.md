# Microwave Oven Case Study - I
## LCD Display
 Displays the amount of time we set for cooking and different modes of cooking.
## Buttons/Touch Screen 
* Helps us in selecting time and mode of cooking.
## Safety Sensor
* This Safety lock sensor gives data to Micro Controller whether door is open or close while cooking. 
## Actuator (Safety Lock)
* Stops the oven if door is open while cooking
## Motor Driver
* Used to drive the motor (Actuator)
## Actuator (Motor)
* Rotates the food while cooking with the help of base plate so that food is cooked uniformly.
## Clock
* This is used to synchronize the Micro controller with other activities.
## Sensor (Heat Detector)
* This sensor gives temperature values to Micro controller and then the HVAC control unit is worked accordingly.
## ROM
* This is a memory module which store Data memory and Program memory respectively
## Relays and voltage Control Unit 
* This system consists of relays and transformer which are controlled by the micro controller.
## Magnetron
* This is activated according to the user selected input with the help of microcontroller.
## Temperature Sensor
* Cuts off the power supply by switching off if temperature exceeds certain limit.
## HVAC Control unit
* Heats and cools the system according to the temperature with the help of microcontroller
## MicroController
* Performs all the important operations and helps our oven to work correctly without any damages by controlling all the inputs and outputs accordingly.
