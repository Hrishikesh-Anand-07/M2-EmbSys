## LCD Display

Displays the amount of time we set for cooking and different modes of cooking.

## Buttons / Touch Screen 

Helps us in selecting time and mode of cooking.

## Safety Sensor

Gives data to Micro Controller whether door is open or close while cooking. 

## Actuator (Safety Lock)

Stops the oven if door is open while cooking.

## Motor Driver

Used to drive the motor (Actuator).

## Actuator (Motor)

Rotates the food while cooking with base plate so that food is cooked uniformly.

## Clock

Used to synchronize the Micro controller with other activities.

## Sensor (Heat Detector)

Gives temperature to Micro controller and HVAC control unit to worked accordingly.

## ROM

Memory module which store Data memory and Program memory respectively

## Relays and voltage Control Unit

It consists of relays and transformer which are controlled by the micro controller.

## Magnetron

It is activated according to the user selected input with the help of microcontroller.

## Temperature Sensor

Cuts off the power supply by switching off if temperature exceeds certain limit.

## HVAC Control unit

Heats and cools the system according to the temperature with the help of microcontroller

## MicroController

Performs all the important operations and helps the oven to work correctly.
